VQE for the Hydrogen Molecule (H2)

This script implements the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm
to find the ground state energy of the H2 molecule. It serves as an end-to-end
acceptance test and a practical demonstration of the rocQuantum framework.

The process includes:
1. Defining the molecular Hamiltonian for H2.
2. Creating a parameterized quantum circuit (ansatz).
3. Using a classical optimizer (SciPy's L-BFGS-B) to minimize the
   expectation value of the Hamiltonian.
4. Calculating the energy and its gradient using rocQuantum's capabilities.
5. Benchmarking the execution time and comparing the result to the known
   theoretical value.
